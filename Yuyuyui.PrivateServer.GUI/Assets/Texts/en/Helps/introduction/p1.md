# What Is This Project

This project, *Jinchōge*, is a private server for the mobile game 
[Yuyuyui](https://yuyuyui.jp/).
It serves as a preservation of the game content after the game shuts down.

The name Jinchōge comes from the flower *Daphne odora* in Japanese.

It also comes with an Account Transfer tool, *Eucalyptus*, that allows you to transfer
your account from the official server to this private server. It supports
both Android and iOS clients.

*For more information about how to use the private server or the account
transfer tool, please check:*
