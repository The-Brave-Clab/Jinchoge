# What Is This Project

This project, *Jinchōge*, is a private server for the mobile game 
[Yuyuyui](https://yuyuyui.jp/).
It serves as a preservation of the game content after the game shuts down.

The name Jinchōge comes from the flower *Daphne odora* in Japanese.

This project supports both Android and iOS clients.
