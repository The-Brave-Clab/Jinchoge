This project is actively in development. However, new in-game features may
or may not come due to the game shutdown.

## How Does It Work

The private server is based on
[Man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
(MITM in short). This technique is used for intercepting the messages from
the game client and creating responses that simulate the behavior of the
original official server.

When you start the private server or the account transfer tool, a proxy
that handles the requests and responses will be started. You are required
to connect your mobile device to the proxy server, download a certificate
that is generated randomly by this program (since the game uses HTTPS for
communication), and trust it manually. After that, your game will be able
to get the responses from the private server, instead of the official server.
