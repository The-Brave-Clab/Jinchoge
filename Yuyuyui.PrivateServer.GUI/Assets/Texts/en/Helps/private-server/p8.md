## Play the Game

You can now play the game as usual. You will notice some differences between
the private server and the official server and that's intended.

**NOTE!**

Due to the client restriction after the shutdown of the official server, if
you have not created an account on your client yet, you will need to press
the _Delete Account_ button, which is the left most button to the top-right
corner of the start screen of the game.

## Stop the Private Server

Use the same button for starting the private server to stop it.

You don't need to stop the private server manually. Closing the window will
also stop it, if it's running.
