You can use the button to the left of the panel to start the account transfer
process.

## Connect to the Proxy

When starting the account transfer too;, a proxy will be started. This proxy
is the same as the one started by the private server, but it behaves differently.
Like the private server, you will also need to connect to this proxy first.

*For how to connect to the proxy, please check the corresponding topic for 
the Private Server:*
