Some of these data will be collected automatically, but some of them can only
be recorded after being accessed manually in the game. For example, to record
the *Event Items* data, you will need to access the Taisha Point shop in the
game.

## Stop the Account Transfer Tool

The account transfer tool will stop automatically when you finish transferring
an account. However, you can also stop the process manually by pressing the
stop button. If you stop the tool during a transfer process, it will result
in an incomplete account.

After you finish transferring an account, you can directly use the private
server with the same device, but you will need to completely exit the game
first.
