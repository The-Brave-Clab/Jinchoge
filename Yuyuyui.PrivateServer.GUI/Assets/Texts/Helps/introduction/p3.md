## Is It Safe?

Daunting as it may sound, it is completely safe, as long as you don't share
the generated certificate with others. Each certificate is generated
randomly, which means that your certificate is different from any other
user, or any other program that utils MITM attack.

The program will only intercept those requests used for running the game.
The program will **not** record any data other than your game account.
However, due to the nature of this program, you have to make sure that you
downloaded it from a trusted source.

***NOTE: Using this program means that you fully understand the risk. The
author(s) of this program does not take any responsibility in case of
any data lost, leaked, or any other event.***
