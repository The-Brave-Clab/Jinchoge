## Play the Game

You can now play the game as usual. You will notice some differences between
the private server and the official server and that's intended.

You can use your transferred account, or you can also create a new account
within the private server.

**IMPORTANT NOTE!**

**If you decided not to use a transferred account, make sure that you transfer
it to another device before connecting to the private server, otherwise your
account will be lost!**

## Stop the Private Server

Use the same button for starting the private server to stop it.

You don't need to stop the private server manually. Closing the window will
also stop it, if it's running.
